Welcome! I'm a senior student at [School of the Gifted Young](https://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/). My major is Statistics.

My research interests broadly span **Network Analysis, Statistical Machine Learning, Biostatistics, and Optimization Theory**. I aim to develop statistical methodologies that provide efficient and interpretable solutions for analyzing large-scale, complex datasets.  

During my undergraduate study at USTC, I had the honor to work with Prof. [Xueqin Wang](https://bs.ustc.edu.cn/english/profile-650.html) on projects in **Machine Learning, Hyperdimensional Computing, and Large-Scale Optimization**. These experiences not only deepened my understanding of statistical methodology and computation, but also greatly enriched my academic journey.  

In the summer of 2025, I spent a wonderful time at the University of Michigan, working with Prof. [Ji Zhu](https://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~jizhu/) and Prof. [Gongjun Xu](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/gongjunxu) on **synthetic network generation and latent space models**. Collaborating with them has been an inspiring and rewarding experience, which broadened my vision and strengthened my passion for research.  

**I am applying for a PhD position in Statistics/Biostatistics/Data Science for Fall 2026.**

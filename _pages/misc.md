My undergraduate years in USTC
======

From 2022 to 2025, I was actively engaged in a variety of activities outside of my coursework.  

I served as a **flute player in the university’s Chinese orchestra** from my freshman year to present.  
During the same period, I was also an **active member of the School of the Gifted Young’s football team**.  
I enjoy playing football not only as a way to exercise, but also for the pure joy of scoring goals and sharing that excitement with my teammates.

In addition, I was a **member of the debate team**, where I practiced critical thinking, public speaking, and collaborative argumentation.  

Traveling
======

I enjoy traveling to explore new places, meet people from different backgrounds, and refresh my mind outside of study and research.  
Traveling gives me both inspiration and balance — every journey offers unique moments of joy and reflection.  

After the intense years from freshman to junior, when I was striving hard for my GPA, I took a few days off to travel around the East Coast of the United States.  
The blend of vibrant cultural landmarks and breathtaking natural scenery made me feel deeply fulfilled and joyful.  
From historic cities to beautiful coastlines, each stop left me with unforgettable impressions and a renewed appreciation for the diversity of the world.

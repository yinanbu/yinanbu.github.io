My undergraduate years in USTC
======

From 2022 to 2025, I was actively engaged in a variety of activities outside of my coursework.  
I served as a **flute player in the university’s Chinese orchestra**.  

During the same period, I was also an **active member of the School of the Gifted Young’s football team**.  
I enjoy playing football not only as a way to exercise, but also for the pure joy of scoring goals and sharing that excitement with my teammates.

In addition, I was a **member of the debate team**, where I practiced critical thinking, public speaking, and collaborative argumentation.
